# React Vite TailwindCSS Starter Template

This project provides a starter template for building fast and modern web applications using React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Wedges. It's designed to offer developers a quick way to jumpstart their projects with a powerful and efficient development stack.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vite leverages modern web technologies to serve your code via native ES Module imports during development, allowing for lightning-fast reloads and a smoother developer experience.

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center`, and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. Tailwind's highly customizable nature allows you to design your site with the speed of a cheetah.

- **Wedges**: While not as commonly known, [Wedges](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/wedges) is an open-source collection of UI components for React that complements this stack by providing [specific functionality or features that Wedges offers, tailored to the context of this template].

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kantbtrue/react-vite-tailwind-wedges-starting-template.git

   ```

2. **Change to your project directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the Vite development server. You can view your application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code. `3000` is the default port, but you can change it in the `vite.config.js` file.

## Customization

- **React Components**: Start building your UI by creating React components. Utilize the power of React's component-based architecture to manage your application's state and behavior.

- **TailwindCSS Styling**: Customize your application's design by editing the tailwind.config.js file or by using Tailwind's utility classes directly in your component markup.

- **Vite Configuration**: Adjust the Vite configuration to optimize your build process or to integrate additional plugins that enhance your development workflow.

- **Wedges Integration**: [Provide guidance on how to integrate or utilize Wedges within this stack, based on the specific roles or features it provides.]
